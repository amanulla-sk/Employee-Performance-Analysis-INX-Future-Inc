# Employee-Performance-Analysis-INX-Future-Inc
End-to-end employee performance analysis using Python — includes data cleaning, EDA, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end employee performance analysis for INX Future Inc, built using Python.  
It covers the complete data science workflow — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

## Objective
The goal is to analyze employee-related data to uncover patterns affecting performance and to build a predictive model that can help HR make better decisions.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
2. Univariate Analysis – Understanding individual feature distributions.
3. Bivariate and Correlation Analysis – Identifying relationships between variables.
4. Feature Selection – Choosing the most impactful predictors.
5. Model Building – Training machine learning models for prediction.
6. Evaluation – Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Recommendations – Insights for improving employee performance.
